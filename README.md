# openweathermap2title
This is just a stupid php script that takes the information from openweathermap.org and puts it in the title of a web page.

The SupyBot web plugin can now fetch that title using
web title https://server/weather.php?q=city 
and somewhat replace the weather plugin without having to modify the bot. 

You still need a web server to proxy the requests and register for an openweathermap api key.
